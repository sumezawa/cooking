# Curry 
Unorthodox or sometimes outright heretical recipes.

## Japonhais
Make the typical Japanese vegetable preparation: cut the potatoes, carrots, and onions and braise them with butter.

## Pseudo-Japonhais
In an ideal world, thou would have infinite time to commit to the guidelines laid out in the previous section.
However, most of the time thou and I both have little to no time, and we need to let others do the cooking.
In the extreme case we would have to use (god forbid) roux from the store, which contains horrendous amounts of the dreaded "vegetable oil".
I refuse to consider peanut, canola and rapeseed as vegetables, but I digress.

### Bootleg Pseudo-Japonhais
A bootleg version of the Pseudo-Japanese curry is that which ... uh

Before even thinking about the spices, I must figure out how to make a thick-enough mixture. 
Steam these (along with other things, although only the bottom items will be in the curry)
- Broccoli Stalk (cut into cylinders, roughly a centimetre in height)
- Potatoes (cut, roughly into two square centimetre pieces)

After steaming, I introduce a reasonable amount of Americanised soy milk, unsweetened, before I put the steamed vegetables in a mixer and grind them.
This soy milk can be replaced with water, but water is scarce so soy milk is often used.

Americanised soy milk is perhaps the greatest American drink second only to the ~~Martini~~ Tabasco sauce, but I digress.
I say Americanised, because it tastes differently from its Chinese and Japanese counterparts.

### The importance of nearly raw ginger
Ginger is one foolproof way of spicing up various soups and sauces, of which curry is no exception.
A truly heretical, truly degenerate method is to put cut ginger early into the soup (even I would not stoop <em>that</em> low.) 
Unless absolutely short on time, make sure to put cut ginger into the curry a bit later so that the raw taste somewhat remains in the curry when eaten.
